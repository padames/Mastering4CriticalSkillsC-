to build and run the app:
$ make run

To end type Ctr + C

To remove all compiled files and the app itself:
$ make clean


The output of the program is:

$ output/app 
1
partial sum of last 4 numbers ( 1 ) = 1

2
partial sum of last 4 numbers ( 1 + 2 ) = 3

3
partial sum of last 4 numbers ( 1 + 2 + 3 ) = 6

4
partial sum of last 4 numbers ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ) = 10

5
partial sum of last 4 numbers ( 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 ) = 14

6
partial sum of last 4 numbers ( 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 ) = 18

6
partial sum of last 4 numbers ( 4 + 5 + 6 + 6 ) = 21

7
partial sum of last 4 numbers ( 5 + 6 + 6 + 7 ) = 24

8
partial sum of last 4 numbers ( 6 + 6 + 7 + 8 ) = 27

9
partial sum of last 4 numbers ( 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 ) = 30
